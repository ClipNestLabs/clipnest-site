<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-08-09</p>

<p>Clipnest is a <strong>personal, non-commercial</strong> project used to learn about automations, agents, orchestration, and AI-assisted creative workflows. Any revenue is an incidental byproduct and not the purpose of this project.</p>

<h2>What We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information from website visitors.</li>
  <li>Operational logs (e.g., service health, error messages) may be stored locally to improve reliability.</li>
  <li>If you contact us by email, we will receive your email address and message contents solely to respond to you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Clipnest may post creative test outputs to third-party platforms such as Pinterest or YouTube to observe platform behavior. These platforms operate under their own privacy policies.</p>

<h2>Use of TikTok Data</h2>
<p>If you choose to connect your TikTok account with Clipnest, we may access certain information from your TikTok profile via TikTok’s API (for example, username, profile image, and basic account details that you explicitly authorize). We use this information only to provide requested features (such as posting or managing content) and to evaluate system behavior. We do not sell or share TikTok data with third parties.</p>
<p>Any tokens granted through TikTok’s OAuth are stored securely and may be revoked by you at any time in your TikTok account settings. We retain TikTok-related data only as long as needed to operate requested features, after which it is deleted or de-identified. Your use of TikTok through Clipnest is also governed by TikTok’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/privacy-policy</a>.</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-08-09</p>

<p>Clipnest is a <strong>personal, non-commercial</strong> project used to explore automations, AI agents, orchestration, and AI-assisted creative workflows. Any revenue is an incidental byproduct and not the primary purpose.</p>

<h2>What We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information from website visitors.</li>
  <li>Operational logs (e.g., service health, error messages) may be stored locally to improve reliability.</li>
  <li>If you contact us by email, we will receive your email address and message contents solely to respond to you.</li>
  <li>When you connect third-party accounts (such as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, X/Twitter, LinkedIn), or any <strong>future platforms we may integrate</strong>, we may temporarily store OAuth tokens and metadata required to perform actions you have authorized (e.g., posting content, retrieving analytics).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Clipnest integrates with third-party platforms including, but not limited to: <em>TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, X/Twitter, LinkedIn</em>, as well as any additional platforms we may support in the future. These services operate under their own terms and privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies for details on how your data is handled by each service.</p>

<h2>How We Use Connected Account Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To process, edit, and format your content for posting.</li>
  <li>To publish or schedule your content on the connected platform(s) you choose.</li>
  <li>To retrieve performance statistics such as views, likes, shares, or audience demographics.</li>
  <li>To generate reports and insights for your review (if enabled).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use your connected account data for targeted advertising or to sell to third parties.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>This site does not use cookies or analytics. Any tracking or analytics occurs solely within the connected third-party platform’s ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>No personal data is sold or shared. Logs and platform-provided statistics are used only for troubleshooting, learning, and improving automated workflows.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>This project is not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>OAuth tokens and related credentials are stored only as long as required for the authorized tasks, then deleted automatically. Operational logs are periodically purged.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this policy as our integrations evolve. The “Last updated” date will reflect the latest version.</p>

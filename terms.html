<h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
<p>Clipnest is a <strong>personal, non‑commercial</strong> project created to explore and learn about automation, AI agents, content orchestration, and short‑form video workflows. Any monetization is incidental and not the primary purpose.</p>

<h2>3. Eligibility</h2>

  <li>Do not submit or post content you do not have rights to.</li>
  <li>Do not circumvent content‑protection technologies or download restricted material.</li>
  <li>Do not attempt to disrupt or interfere with the Service’s operation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. User Content &amp; Rights</h2>
<p>You retain ownership of any content you upload or authorize the Service to access. By submitting content or connecting accounts, you grant Clipnest a limited, non‑exclusive license to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Process, edit, clip, and format that content;</li>
  <li>Post, schedule, or otherwise publish it to connected platforms on your behalf; and</li>
  <li>Store and analyze related metadata and performance statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and permissions for this content, including any music, images, or third‑party materials.</p>

<h2>6. Third‑Party Platforms &amp; APIs</h2>
<p>The Service may integrate with third‑party platforms including, but not limited to: <em>TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, X/Twitter, LinkedIn</em>. These services operate under their own terms and privacy policies. By connecting your accounts, you authorize Clipnest to perform actions within the scope of permissions you grant (such as uploading videos, retrieving analytics, or scheduling posts). You are responsible for complying with each platform’s rules and guidelines.</p>

<h2>7. AI‑Assisted Processing</h2>
<p>Clipnest uses AI‑powered tools for tasks such as transcribing, detecting highlights, generating captions, cropping and formatting, applying visual overlays, and suggesting hashtags, titles, or descriptions. AI‑generated outputs are provided “as‑is” and may contain errors. You are responsible for reviewing all outputs before publishing.</p>

<h2>8. No Warranty</h2>
<p>The Service is provided “as‑is” without warranties of any kind. Clipnest does not guarantee uninterrupted or error‑free operation, or compatibility with every platform.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Clipnest shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service, including content removal or account suspension by third‑party platforms.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The “Last updated” date will reflect the latest version.</p>
